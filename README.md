# Nordic-Code
This repo is used to create my own programming language called Nordic Code.

**THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT**

~~Currently working on the interpreter to read in the helloworld.nord test file and parse through each line to understand and interpret what to do with that line.~~

Planning to work with different data types next, mostly with integers and strings for right now.
